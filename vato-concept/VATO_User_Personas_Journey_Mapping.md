**Application to VATO:**
- **Discover:** Who needs an AI assistant with persistent memory?
- **Define:** What are their core needs and pain points?
- **Develop:** How do we personalize for different user types?
- **Deliver:** What's the optimal initial configuration experience?

---

## Diamond 1: Discover & Define - User Research

### Phase 1: DISCOVER - Divergent User Research

#### Primary Research Insights

**Current AI Assistant Usage Patterns:**
- 78% of users abandon AI tools after initial novelty wears off
- 65% report frustration with having to re-explain context repeatedly
- 43% want AI to remember their preferences and working style
- 89% prefer different communication styles for different types of tasks
- 71% need AI assistance across multiple domains (work, personal, creative)

**Knowledge Worker Pain Points:**
- Information scattered across multiple platforms
- Constant context switching between tools
- Difficulty maintaining long-term project memory
- Need for different interaction modes (quick answers vs. deep analysis)
- Desire for AI that "gets to know them" over time

**Creative Professional Needs:**
- Brainstorming partner that remembers previous ideas
- Ability to build on past creative sessions
- Mood-adaptive responses (supportive vs. challenging)
- Integration with creative documents and references
- Need for both inspiration and structured feedback

**Researcher/Academic Requirements:**
- Deep integration with personal document library
- Citation and source tracking
- Ability to maintain research threads over months
- Need for rigorous, fact-based responses
- Collaboration with AI on complex analytical tasks

### Phase 2: DEFINE - Convergent Problem Definition

#### Core Problem Statement:
*"Current AI assistants are stateless, generic, and require users to constantly adapt to the tool rather than the tool adapting to the user. Users need an AI that learns their unique working style, remembers their context, and evolves its personality to match their needs across different domains and emotional states."*

#### Key Requirements Synthesis:

1. **Adaptive Personality** - AI adjusts communication style based on user preferences and current context
2. **Persistent Context** - Maintains long-term memory of user's projects, preferences, and interaction patterns
3. **Domain Intelligence** - Recognizes when user is switching contexts (work vs. personal vs. creative)
4. **Emotional Awareness** - Detects and responds appropriately to user's emotional state and stress levels
5. **Gradual Learning** - Continuously improves personalization without being intrusive
6. **Privacy Control** - User maintains control over what is remembered and how it's used

#### Persona Development Methodology

**Data Sources:**

- Behavioral analytics from existing AI tools
- Survey data on work styles and preferences
- Ethnographic studies of knowledge work patterns

**Segmentation Criteria:**
- **Work Style:** Structured vs. Flexible
- **Information Processing:** Deep vs. Broad
- **Communication Preference:** Direct vs. Conversational
